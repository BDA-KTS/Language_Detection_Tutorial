# Detecting Languages with Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

Language detection is a key tool in text analytics, enabling researchers to classify documents, messages, and other textual data into their respective languages. With the rise of social media and globalization, detecting languages in multilingual datasets is essential for insights in fields like social sciences, marketing, and natural language processing (NLP). In this tutorial, we will explore how to perform language detection using Python and the langdetect library in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Understand the basics of language detection.
- Set up a Python environment for language detection tasks.
- Implement a simple language detection tool using Python libraries.
- Evaluate the detected languages for datasets and real-world use cases.

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for:

- Researchers in social sciences and linguistics interested in multilingual data analysis.
- Students or professionals beginning their journey in NLP.
- Data analysts working with diverse language datasets.
- Anyone curious about language detection tools in Python.

## Duration
1 Hour

## Social Science Use Cases
**Survey Analysis:** Determine the primary languages in multilingual survey responses.

**Media Studies:** Analyze the distribution of languages in social media posts or news articles.

## Setting Up the Computational Environment
```
pip install langdetect pandas matplotlib
```
